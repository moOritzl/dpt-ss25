# Discrete Probability Theory ‚Äì SS25

**Course by Niki Kilbertus @ TUM**

These are my personal notes and materials for exam preparation in the *Discrete Probability Theory* lecture, SS25. The
notes are based on the exercises, highlighted problems from the lecturer, and the mock exam.

## Exam Preparation Aids

- [**My Cheatsheet**](dpt-cheatsheet.pdf): The actual A4 double-sided handwritten cheatsheet I will use in the exam.
- [**Cheatsheet Topics Overview**](cheatsheet-topics.md): A categorized overview of all topics covered on the
  cheatsheet.
- [**Probability Distributions Summary**](distributions.md): Compact table of relevant distributions (discrete &
  continuous) with properties and formulas.
- [**Test Statistics Overview**](test_statistics.md): Summary of test statistics (Z, t, etc.), their formulas,
  assumptions, and usage.

## Exam Relevance

The materials in this repo focus primarily on:

- Exercises **highlighted by the professor** as relevant for the exam.
- Typical concepts, computations, and modeling techniques expected in the exam.
- Practicing how to express reasoning under tight time and space constraints (e.g. for the cheat sheet).
